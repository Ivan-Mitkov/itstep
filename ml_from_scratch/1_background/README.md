# Lecture 1: Mathematic background

This lecture aims at introducing the mathematical concepts we will be using throughout the course (linear algebra, calculus, statistics, numerical optimization). 
Note that this does not serve as a mathematics cours in itself. 
The students interested in a more formal and academic can refer to these materials

- [Pr. Boyd's course on convex optimization](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3940DD956CDF0622)

This folder contains the material related to the first lecture.
