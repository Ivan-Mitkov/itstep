# Lecture 3: Ordinary Least Squares implementation

This lab session consists in implementing the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) algorithm we have seen during lectures 1 and 2.
This folder contains a Jupyter notebook [`least-squares.ipynb`](least-squares.ipynb) that will guide you though the implementation of the OLS algorithm.
